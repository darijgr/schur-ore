# Do the symmetric functions have a function-field analogue?

This is a technical-report-in-progress on my explorations of a
function-field analogue of the Witt vectors. The goals are to
obtain function-field analogues of all standard results about
Witt vectors, and (more daringly) to find a function-field analogue
of the ring of symmetric functions as well (by mimicking the
viewpoint of Hazewinkel, Borger and others, according to which the
ring of symmetric functions is the representing object of the Witt
vector functor). Currently, the first goal is partly reached (the
main properties of Witt vectors do have function-field analogues,
but the proofs mostly remain to be written up), whereas the second
goal still seems far away (I can define the representing object of
the function-field Witt vector functor, but no combinatorial
structure behind it is in sight).
